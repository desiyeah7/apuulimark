<h1>Motivation Stories</h1>
<p>These are stories i could tell from my expirence and i hope they motivate you.</p>
<p>1.<span class="highlight">The Day I Almost Gave Up</span><br>
        There was a moment in my life when i felt completely empty<br>
              	Nothing made sense<br>
               Nothing motivated me <br>
  it felt like everything i worked for, was falling apart.<br>
          But that day taught me something important,<br>
             sometimes its okay to start again.<br>
       Not because you failed , but because you have grown.  </p>
       

<p>2.<span class="highlight">The People Who Left</span> <br>
     Some people i cared deeply about walked out of my life.<br>
          At first , i was hurt.<br>
   But with time , i realised something powerful.<br> 
 Not everyone who leaves, is meant to stay <br>
     some leave , so you can find your self.<br>
       Loss became strenght<br>
        Pain became wisdom<br>
        Loneliness became clarity.</p>

<p>3.<span class="highlight">Learning To Beieve In Your Self</span><br>
    For a long time i doubted my self. I felt like i wasn't doing <br>
      enough,Achieving enough, or Becoming enough.<br>
 But step by step , i leartned to believe in my own potential.<br>
    Not beacause some one told me to...<br>
       but i learned that i deserve to grow</p>


<h1>The most powerful part</h1>
<p>If you're reading this, i want you to know something.<br>
 You are stronger than your fears<br>
You are bigger than your past<br>
You are worthy of every dream inside your heart</p>


<p>Life will test you<br>
it will break you in places you didn't know could break.<br>
But it will also rebuild you,Stronger, Wiser, and more alive</p>


<p>Keep going<br>
Keep believing<br>
Keep becoming.</p>

<p>Your story is far from ever.<br>
And the world is waiting for the version <br>
that is becoming unstoppable.</p>
