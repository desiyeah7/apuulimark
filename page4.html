<h1> Education Background</h1>
    <p><span class="highlight">Primary Education</span><br>

From my early years, my journey of learning began with<br>
 strong foundations shaped by dedication and hope.<br>
I attended:<br></p>
<ul type="circle">


<li>Hope Primary School</li>
<img src="hope.jpg" class="img-two"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li>Bukoto Primary School</li>
<img src="bukoto.jpg" class="img-three"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<li>Kabarole Primary School</li><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

</ul>

<p>Each school played a special role in building my character<br>
 — teaching me discipline, courage, and the belief that<br>
 no dream is too big.</p>

My next chapter took me to:</p>
<ul type="circle"><br>
<br>

<li>Divine Mercy</li>
<img src="divine.jpg" class="img-four"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<li>Kitumba Secondary School</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>These years were full of challenges that strengthened me,<br>
 lessons that opened my eyes, and experiences that shaped <br>
the man I am becoming today.<br>
It taught me responsibility, focus, and the power of <br>
believing in myself even when the road was tough.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">University</span><br>

I am proud to continue my journey at:<br></p>
<ul type="cicle">
<li>Team University</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="team.jpg" class="img-seven">

<p>Here, I am not just studying — I am building my future.<br>
 Every lecture, every project, and every challenge <br>
pushes me closer to the person I dream to become.<br>
Team University has given me confidence, purpose, <br>
and a clearer path toward my goals in IT.</p>
