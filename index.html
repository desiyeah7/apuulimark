<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome to my space, Not a space of perfection , but a space of truth-<br>
       where every chapter of my life, both light and dark,<br>
          has shaped who i am becoming.</p>

<p>My name is Alinda RickMark, and i believe every person carries a story <br>
           that the world needs to hear.</p>

<p>This is mine.</p>
<p>A story of<span class="highlight"> trying , falling,raising,breaking,healing,<br>
       learning, and becoming</span>.</p>
<p>A story still in progress,still being written,<br>
      one courageous step at a time.</p> 


<p>If you ever felt lost, tired, or unsure of yourself...<br>
   then i hope my story reminds you that you are not<br>
              alone.</p>
 
<h1>My Story</h>
<p>I grew up learning that life doesn't always give you what you want-<br>
    sometimes it gives you what  you need to grow.</p>
<p>I have lived through moments that tested my strength,<br>
     Moments that left me speechless,Moments that forced<br>
        me to rebuild my life from the inside.</p>
<p>There were days my heart was heavy...<br>
   Days when things didn't go as planned...<br>
  Days when i looked at the mirror and wondered<br>
    if i was enough.<br>
 But every challenge came with a hidden gift,<br>
  pain taught me empathy.<br>
 Failure taught me resilience<br>
 loneliness taught me self-love<br>
 And hope- even when it was small- taught me <br>
     to keep moving forward.</p>


<p>The truth is am not perfect. I have made mistakes,<br>
    I have lost people, and i have questioned my path<br>
     many times.<br>
But am still here...still fighting...still growing<br>
        And alone is a VICTORY.</p>
